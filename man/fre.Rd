\title{Simple frequencies with support of labels, weights and multiple response variables.}
\usage{
fre(
  x,
  weight = NULL,
  drop_unused_labels = TRUE,
  prepend_var_lab = FALSE,
  stat_lab = getOption("expss.fre_stat_lab", c("Count", "Valid percent", "Percent",
    "Responses, \%", "Cumulative responses, \%"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector/data.frame/list. data.frames are considered as multiple
response variables. If \code{x} is list then vertically stacked frequencies
for each element of list will be generated,}

\item{weight}{numeric vector. Optional case weights. NA's and negative weights
treated as zero weights.}

\item{drop_unused_labels}{logical. Should we drop unused value labels?
Default is TRUE.}

\item{prepend_var_lab}{logical. Should we prepend variable label before value
labels? By default we will add variable labels to value labels only if
\code{x} or predictor is list (several variables).}

\item{stat_lab}{character. Labels for the frequency columns.}
}
\value{
object of class 'etable'. Basically it's a data.frame but class
  is needed for custom methods.
}
\description{
\code{fre} returns data.frame with six columns: labels or values, counts, 
valid percent (excluding NA), percent (with NA), percent of responses(for 
single-column \code{x} it equals to valid percent) and cumulative percent of 
responses.
